# AI Tools Usage Disclosure

This document discloses the use of AI tools during the development of the Storm Chaser mobile application.

## AI Tools Used

### 1. Claude (Anthropic)
- **Purpose**: Primary development assistant for this project
- **Usage**: Code generation, architecture design, problem solving, and documentation


### 2. GitHub Copilot (if applicable)
- **Purpose**: Code completion and suggestions
- **Usage**: Real-time code suggestions during development

## Specific AI-Assisted Development Areas

### Architecture and Design
- **Project Structure**: AI assisted in designing the folder structure and organizing code into logical modules
- **Design Patterns**: Service layer pattern, custom hooks, and component composition were discussed and refined with AI
- **Type Definitions**: TypeScript interfaces and types were generated with AI assistance

### Code Generation
- **Service Classes**: Database, weather, location, and camera services were generated with AI assistance
- **Custom Hooks**: `useWeather` and `useStormDocumentation` hooks were created with AI guidance
- **UI Components**: WeatherCard, StormCard, and other reusable components were generated
- **Screen Components**: All main screens (Weather, Storm Documentation, Capture Storm, Storm Detail) were created with AI assistance
- **Utility Functions**: Helper functions for formatting, validation, and data manipulation

### API Integration
- **Weather API**: Open-Meteo integration code was generated with AI assistance
- **Error Handling**: Fallback mechanisms and error handling patterns were implemented with AI guidance
- **Data Models**: Weather data mapping and transformation logic

### Database Implementation
- **SQLite Schema**: Database table structure and queries were designed with AI assistance
- **CRUD Operations**: Database service methods for create, read, update, delete operations
- **Data Mapping**: Object-relational mapping between TypeScript types and database rows

### UI/UX Design
- **Theme System**: Light/dark mode implementation and color schemes
- **Component Styling**: StyleSheet definitions and responsive design
- **Navigation**: React Navigation setup and configuration

### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Jest test cases for utility functions were generated with AI assistance
- **Test Structure**: Test organization and best practices

### Documentation
- **README.md**: Comprehensive documentation was written with AI assistance
- **Code Comments**: Inline documentation and comments throughout the codebase
- **API Documentation**: Weather API integration documentation

## Human Development Contributions

### Manual Implementation
- **Project Setup**: Initial Expo project creation and dependency installation
- **Configuration**: App.json configuration and platform-specific settings
- **Debugging**: Manual testing and bug fixes
- **Code Review**: Review and refinement of AI-generated code
- **Integration**: Manual integration of different components and services

### Creative Decisions
- **Feature Prioritization**: Deciding which features to implement
- **UI/UX Choices**: Final design decisions and user experience considerations
- **Technology Selection**: Choosing React Native, Expo, and other technologies
- **Architecture Decisions**: Final architectural patterns and data flow design

## Code Quality Assurance

### AI-Generated Code Review
- All AI-generated code was reviewed and tested
- TypeScript errors were manually fixed
- Performance optimizations were applied where needed
- Code style and consistency were maintained

### Manual Testing
- All features were manually tested on different devices
- Edge cases and error scenarios were verified
- User experience was validated through manual testing

## Transparency and Ethics

### Full Disclosure
- This document provides complete transparency about AI tool usage
- All AI-assisted development areas are clearly identified
- Human contributions and decisions are explicitly documented

### Code Ownership
- All code is original and properly attributed
- No copyrighted or proprietary code was used
- All dependencies are properly licensed and documented

### Quality Standards
- AI-generated code meets the same quality standards as manually written code
- All code follows React Native and TypeScript best practices
- Performance and security considerations were applied throughout

## Conclusion

The Storm Chaser application was developed with significant assistance from AI tools, primarily for code generation, architecture design, and documentation. However, all critical decisions, testing, debugging, and final implementation were performed by human developers. The AI tools served as productivity enhancers and development assistants, but the final product represents a collaborative effort between human expertise and AI assistance.

The use of AI tools significantly accelerated the development process while maintaining high code quality and comprehensive feature implementation. All AI-generated code was thoroughly reviewed, tested, and refined to ensure it meets professional standards and assessment requirements.
